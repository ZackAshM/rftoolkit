# rftoolkit

This python package provides some general tools for RF analysis.

### Version 0:
- rftoolkit.waveform
This module provides the Waveform class which handles voltage vs time data and common manipulations.
- rftoolkit.VNA
This module provides the S2P class which handles s2p data measured from a VNA.
- rftoolkit.Tx2Rx
This module provides gain and impulse response calculations from a direct pulsing measurement, sending a pulse from Tx to Rx.
- rftoolkit.plotter
This module provides plotting functions for more involved plotting. Currently provides a plotting function for beam patterns.


This is my first package intended to be used by others, so bear with me as I figure out path+import issues.
